## Data Collection
Image Scout **does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII)**.  

The only data processed by the extension is:

- **Image metadata**: When you click on an image, its dimensions, type, and file size are read locally within your browser.  
- **Image content**: If you choose to download or convert the image, the file is processed locally in your browser using standard web APIs.

This data is not transmitted to any external server, nor stored beyond your active browsing session.

## Permissions Justification
The extension requests the following Chrome permissions:

- **activeTab**: To allow code execution only on the tab you choose when activating the extension.  
- **scripting**: To inject the logic that highlights and selects images.  
- **downloads**: To enable downloading of the selected image in original or converted format.  
- **storage**: To temporarily keep the last selected image metadata within the browser session.  
- **host_permissions (`<all_urls>`)**: To allow image selection on any website the user chooses.

These permissions are strictly limited to enabling the extensionâ€™s single purpose.

- No data is sold, shared, or used for advertising purposes.
